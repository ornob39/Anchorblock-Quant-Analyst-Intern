      <description>Listed in the following table are problem sets and solutions. Students in the class were able to work on the assigned problems in the PDF file, then use an interactive problem set checker to input each answer into a box and find out if the answer was correct or incorrect. Students could use the problem set checker as many times as they wanted to, and they werenâ€™t graded on this in any way.</description>
