In this image, for example, we projected a likelihood table onto the whiteboards so that students could construct confidence intervals without needing to first copy down the table.\n\nAlthough students spent considerable time working on board problems, this iteration of the course covered as much or more material than past versions of the course. The key difference was that instead of instructors working out examples on the board, students worked on problems themselves. We believe it’s much more beneficial for students to work out one example than for them to watch an instructor work out two. When they worked on the problems themselves, they could quickly identify what they did not understand and seek help.","credit":"Image courtesy of OCW.","image-alt":"Small groups of students gather around whiteboards and work together on solving math problems. The students work directly on likelihood tables that are projected onto the whiteboards."}}
