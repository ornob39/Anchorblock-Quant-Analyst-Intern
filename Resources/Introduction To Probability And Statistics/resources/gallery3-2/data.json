We either described the distribution of responses to the class or projected the histogram directly.\n\nDisagreements among students served as excellent opportunities for discussions. We often asked students to discuss their answers with their table-mates and try to convince each other. Students could change their answers, and there was often a feedback loop.","credit":"Image courtesy of OCW.","image-alt":"A histogram shows that in response to the question, “Which treatment would you choose?,” 3% of students chose the answer “cured 100%,” 45% chose “cured 95%,” and 52% chose “cured 90%.”"}}
