In class, we taught under the assumption that the students had done the readings. Lectures were brief summaries, kept short to allow ample time for active student work. We usually tried to have the students working on a problem within the first 15 minutes of class.\n\nFor each class session, we created a slide deck that contained lecture content as well as problems for the students to work on. After class, we added problem solutions to the slide deck and posted them online for student use.","credit":"Image courtesy of OCW.","image-alt":"An instructor points at a projector screen showing a slide and addresses students, who are sitting at round tables."}}
