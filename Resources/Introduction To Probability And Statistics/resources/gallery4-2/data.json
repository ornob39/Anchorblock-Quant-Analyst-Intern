Students were more focused without the distraction of their computers and smartphones. They were energized by physically changing positions. Sharing whiteboard space encouraged conversation and collaboration. Students could also look at each other’s work for hints and ideas, and we could easily observe their strategies and progress. Working at the whiteboards was a huge part of the course.\n\nFor board problems, the physical classroom was fantastic. There was ample room for students to rapidly get out of their seats, find board space, work on a problem comfortably, and get back in their seats.\n\nStudents learned a lot from each other, especially when they discussed their ideas as a group. If one student had a stronger understanding of the material, that student might take the lead on a particular problem. Students were also able to look at other students’ work or interact with other groups if they were stuck.","credit":"Image courtesy of OCW.","image-alt":"Small groups of students gather around whiteboards and work together on solving math problems."}}
