  "content":"Listed in the following table are the in-class slides and post-class materials for each of the class sessions. The post-class version of the slides contains the solutions to the board problems, clicker questions, and discussion questions that were posed to the students during class. It was not always the case that the end of the planned set of slides was reached in each class, so the last slides in one deck may be repeated in the next deck.\nWEEK # SES # IN-CLASS SLIDES POST-CLASS SLIDES Probability 1 C1 Introduction, counting and sets (PDF) Class 1 Slides with Solutions (PDF) C2 Probability basics (PDF) Class 2 Slides with Solutions (PDF) 2 C3 Conditional probability, Bayes\u0026rsquo; theorem (PDF) Class 3 Slides with Solutions (PDF) C4 Discrete random variables, expectation (PDF) Class 4 Slides with Solutions (PDF) 3 C5 Variance, continuous random variables (PDF)\nGallery of continuous variables, histograms (PDF)\nClass 5 Slides with Solutions (PDF)\nClass 5 Slides, cont\u0026rsquo;d with Solutions (PDF)\n4 C6 Expectation, variance, law of large numbers and central limit theorem (PDF) Class 6 Slides with Solutions (PDF) C7 Joint distributions: Independence, covariance and correlation (PDF) Class 7 Slides with Solutions (PDF) 5 C8 Review for exam 1 (PDF) Class 8 Slides with Solutions (PDF) C9 No slides; exam 1 during class Statistics: Bayesian Inference 5 C10 Introduction to statistics; maximum likelihood estimates (PDF) Class 10 Slides with Solutions (PDF) 6 C11 Bayesian updating with known discrete priors (PDF) Class 11 Slides with Solutions (PDF) C12 Bayesian updating: Probabilistic prediction; odds (PDF) Class 12 Slides with Solutions (PDF) 7 C13 Bayesian updating: Continuous prior, discrete data (PDF) Class 13 Slides with Solutions (PDF) C14 Beta distributions: Continuous data (PDF) Class 14 Slides with Solutions (PDF) 8 C15 Conjugate priors; choosing priors (PDF) Class 15 Slides with Solutions (PDF) C16 Probability intervals (PDF) Class 16 Slides with Solutions (PDF) Statistics: Frequentist Inference—Null Hypothesis Significance Testing (NHST) 9 C17 Frequentist methods; NHST (PDF - 1.1MB) Class 17 Slides with Solutions (PDF - 1.4MB) C18 NHST II: Significance level, power, t-tests (PDF) Class 18 Slides with Solutions (PDF) 10 C19 NHST III: Gallery of tests (PDF) Class 19 Slides with Solutions (PDF) C20 Comparison of Bayesian and frequentist inference (PDF) Class 20 Slides with Solutions (PDF) 11 C21 Review for exam 2 (PDF) Solutions file: Review of exam 2 (PDF) Statistics: Confidence Intervals; Regression 12 C22 Confidence intervals for normal data (PDF) Class 22 Slides with Solutions (PDF) C23 Confidence intervals II (PDF) Class 23 Slides with Solutions (PDF) 13 C24 Bootstrap confidence intervals (PDF) Class 24 Slides with Solutions (PDF) C25 Linear regression (PDF) Class 25 Slides with Solutions (PDF) 14 C26 Problems file: Review for final exam (PDF)\nSolutions file: Review of final exam (PDF)\nC27 Problems file: Review for final exam, cont\u0026rsquo;d (PDF)\nSolutions file: Review of final exam, cont\u0026rsquo;d (PDF)\n"}
