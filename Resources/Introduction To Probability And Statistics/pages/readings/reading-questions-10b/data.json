Every checker box can do arithmetic and calculate standard functions (see calculator help). If you give decimal answers, give them to at least 3 decimal places.\nAs you work you should have pencil and paper handy for calculations and thinking!\nNote: some questions ask for a formula. For the checker we ask you to plug a value into the formula. For your pset you still need to give the whole formula.\n//DEBUG PARAMETERS //Because we don\u0026rsquo;t show solutions for pset checkers we use //this to give a showanswer button during the debugging phase var debugans = undefined; //release //var debugans = kDebugAnswer; //debug problemNumber = 0; wl(\u0026quot;\u0026lt;h3\u0026gt;Calculator\u0026lt;/h3\u0026gt;\u0026quot;); writecalculator(\u0026ldquo;psetcheckcalcid\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Calculate\u0026rdquo;); whr(kdivcol,kdivwid);\n//Problem 1 problemNumber++; wl(problemheader(problemNumber)); var s; var partName, problemName, buttonLabel, answerArray, correct; s = \u0026ldquo;There are $n$ students in a class.
