  "content":" Using the clickers allowed us to see studentsâ€™ responses and gauge their understanding. We either described the distribution of responses to the class or projected the histogram directly. Disagreements among students served as excellent opportunities for discussions. We often asked students to discuss their answers with their table-mates and try to convince each other. Students could change their answers, and there was often a feedback loop. We often discussed these questions as a whole class in order to identify key reasons why students chose each of the most popular answers. When there was clear and immediate consensus, we kept our explanation brief or immediately moved on. "}
